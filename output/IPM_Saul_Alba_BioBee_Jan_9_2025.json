So I've already been bit. But is there anybody here who has an insect that they would like to dive into? Because otherwise, I'm just going to start us off with thrips, you know, because thrips for me is I kind of rank bugs in what order i'd prefer to get them as opposed to not get them and thrips are you know like fungus gnats i don't really care about they're they're an aesthetic problem they're an annoyance yeah they can get up in really high populations sometimes but they're easy to deal with and cause relative or little to no damage. After that, for me, it's kind of thrips because they really don't, I mean, even with high populations, you're not going to lose your crop unless you have like a biological fail, if you got so many that they're in the buds and that kind of thing. But they're one of the hardest to get. And I know that Suzanne would be mad at me for saying eliminating but like if that's the goal like eliminate two spotted spider mites can do a ton of damage overnight they're pretty easy to get rid of um when it comes to thrips i feel like they they're the one that sticks around sticks around sticks Yeah, I'm glad that you prefaced that with the severity of the pest, actually. I would agree with you that fungus gnats and thrips happen to be on the lower level of priority. I put russet mite way up at the top, but still, yeah, we do have to focus on that, on what Suzanne is getting at when she says the word shouldn't be eliminate. The word is manage. Manage to a point where they're not causing economic harm, right? You can sit there and throw everything at thrips and end up losing money as a result because you've only controlled a tiny bit of the damage that they did. You never got rid of them. So managing them is really the goal. Zero thrips damage is not a goal, in my opinion. Zero thrips presence is not a goal. Managing them so that they're not easy to find, that's the way, that's how I would look at it. And that all starts with monitoring. So if you're not doing, one thing I have found with the, sorry about my throat, I caught a cold, but one thing I've noticed that is very common among the cannabis growers, tendency not to monitor the way that other greenhouse crops do. You've seen the yellow sticky cards that people have out there. Those are intended to be used as monitoring tools. But what I mean by that is you don't need many in one in a small area. You know, there's there's guidelines. And if anyone's interested, Tad and Brandon can, you know, forward you my contact and I can give you some guidelines that are actually published, you know, from the University of California on density of traps. But the goal of those traps is that you're monitoring on a weekly basis and you're recording counts and you're watching those populations go up or down. At some point point you can establish a count of thrips per week that is tolerable to you and when you go above that count is when you bring in the first decision of some type of a management and if if that doesn't work you go to the next decision and hopefully it's a graded decision making process for when you know okay i'm using predatory uh mites for thrips i'm i've been using them at you know x mites per square foot for the last few months but but they're just not keeping up because i passed that threshold that i like to keep them at um so what's my first step? Okay, well, I'm going to maybe raise the rate that I've been using them, or I might raise the frequency, or I might say, hey, I'm going to go to a second predator. Now I've been doing it with just one predator, but, and if it continues, you know, you get to a point where you say, okay, now I need a spray. I really need to think about doing something with my sprays and, you know, all the way up to what's, you know, I guess worst case would be, you know, you eliminate the plants. But monitoring is really critical to me to be able to decide, okay, you've got to decide what do I consider the tolerable population of thrips in my grow. And at that point, I'm going to have a plan for what I'm going to do. As long as I keep it below that point, I'm happy. I know that I'm succeeding. I know that I'm going to get a yield out of this and I'm going to make a profit from this. It's once I get above that I'm really going to have to start getting aggressive. So it's kind of the way that it's done um in many greenhouses where you use that that monitoring tool yellow sticky cards or blue sticky cards whichever you use for thrips isn't the only way to monitor for them there's um there's also i don't know if many of you have seen the beet scout method where you actually beat the foliage and knock thrips out of it. And, you know, you get actual counts there. These are plant counts, right? And it's a little better, but it's a little bit more involved, right? Yellow sticky cards are good for very, very low levels of thrips populations to give you an idea of when, A, they're climbing, but the real indicator there is going to be what's actually on the plants and feeding. And even then, just finding high thrips counts on variety, was next to that other variety. And the younger one was eaten up by thrips. It had a ton of damage on the leaves, and there was hardly anything on the other variety. So just because there's presence of thrips there in yellow cards or on taps doesn't mean that the thrips actually enjoys eating that plant or eats it or eats where it's going to cause damage if you get what i'm saying what are they doing there i don't know what they're doing there but you can find them in high populations and not a not a bit of damage but yeah always keep that in mind is um with the thrips is um you know they they are considered now i think by most of us of us that have worked in this with cannabis pest management. They're not considered to be as problematic as something like a two-spotted spider mite or a cannabis aphid or a russet mite. They are kind of, in my opinion, still now down there. Down there, no. If we're able to find something in the future, knock on wood, it doesn't happen, that they can transmit some sort of a virus or even move the hot plate and thyroid, which so far there is no real data. However, there is some evidence. So everybody just keep an eye on that. Then that's a game changer. That completely changes, you know, with how we look at thrips. But yeah, the thing about thrips is there are at least five different biocontrol options. They have the two thrips you talked about, the western flower thrips and the onion thrips, are typically what is found in cannabis. I've also seen chili thrips, and I've seen other thrips that I could not identify. I don't know if they were causing much damage, but both the onion thrips and the western flower thrips do have both above-ground and below-ground life stages. And it's obviously smart to target as many stages as you can justify targeting. So nematodes like Brandon was saying, you know, that's a great option for them. But there are also predatory soil mites and predatory beetles like the rove beetles that will also feed on them and can help with the control. And then there's the above-ground predators. You have primarily two predators, predatory mites that are used for thrips management. One of them is Ambliseus kukumaris, and the other one is Ambliseus swirski. I'm sure all of you have heard of them. Swirski is more expensive than kukumaris, but it can manage two larval stages, whereas Cucameras really only handles that first larval stage. Then there's the minute pirate bug, Oreus. That's just a thrips monster. It just, it'll eat anything that, any thrips that it can catch above ground. Very aggressive. I can't remember how many, I can't remember hearing they kill like 45 thrips a day, but only feed on like a third of those or a half of those. They go around stabbing thrips just to see what they taste like, I guess. And they only eat the ones they like. I guess like we do with boxes of chocolate right there's a great picture of uh of one with with uh thrips like just stuck to its you know and it's just cruising around it's not even trying to eat it it's just yeah it's just carrying it for lunch later it's like donkeys carry uh coyotes around yeah around. It's what it reminded me of. Yeah. I have a customer who they're in Los Angeles, an indoor grower, and they love Oreos. And they release Oreos just very regularly. And I told him, you don't have to release them that frequently. And he's like, no, but i just love them they do a number on them and then he showed me a photo from the very first time he released aureus and it's a photo of two aureus after actually having a tug-of-war with the thrips it was like i still have it if anyone wants to see that it's not it's not in focus but it's super cool yeah i'd love to see that yeah uh so yeah um uh let's see uh lacewing you know another generalist that also can help with rips typically they're used for aphids but you know having them around is good because basically predators like lacewing and aureus, they'll pretty much go attack and attempt to kill and will kill anything they can overpower. And sometimes even things they can't overpower. They're just hungry. And, you know, lacewing in particular are cannibalistic. They'll go after their brothers and sisters. their brothers and sisters so um if you have them out there if you have a population of them out there and you're finding them out there you're seeing them go through all their developmental stages and come to adulthood it probably means they're eating something out there and likely it's going to mean they're eating something that's a pest because pests typically tend to be more slow moving than predators right so it's easier you run across a colony of spider mites hey you just have to sit there and you know just pick them up and you know just sit there all day long and feed on them like i guess like if like we had a great cluster in your hand right so so those are always good right yeah okay so um as far as thrips, is there any sort of foliars, any sort of soil drenches, anything like that you'd recommend? Yeah. Yeah. I have a strategy that I learned about when I was working in organic herbs. herbs um i didn't i'd heard about it and never really tried it but but learned more about it after i moved on into cannabis um you know in most states spinosads are not allowed i don't know what washington and oregon i don't know what their laws are um spinosads are great for you know for managing drips until they're no longer, until there's resistance. But I heard this from a grower who was, you know, when he managed thrips, he'd always, he had this trick up his sleeve. And apparently he's not the only one that knows about this because I've heard it from many growers since. There's a product called the Captiva, Captiva Prime. I don't know if you've ever heard of that. Actually, I think I mentioned to this in an email that you were copying it, Brandon. Yeah, basically, it's a product that contains a capsaicin oleoresin. So capsaicin is like what's in peppers, you know, what's in pepper spray. And the thought here is, and it makes sense, and I have some experience with it, that if you mix your spinosads with this product in very low concentration of this product, you don't need a lot, it's really irritating to thrips. And thrips are really good at hiding in nooks and crannies. And that means your coverage for any spray is very, you know, it's limited for thrips. Spider mites are, you know, sitting ducks. They're just, they don't hide. They're just right there under the leaf. And thrips, if they feel a rustling of the wind from a sprayer coming by, they may decide to dive into a crevice. And that's enough to give them the protection they need because guess what? The materials we can use in cannabis are not poisons. They usually require some kind of a physical contact. So including a capsaicin, you know, oleoresin like this irritates them and basically gets them out of hiding. It's kind of like, how could I say, like, if you're in a war, right, and you throw a smoke bomb into a building and all the soldiers come rushing out, you know, now they're exposed. Right. That's the strategy. Right. So it works with spinosads. Now, I know we can't use them in cannabis, but I have customers who have tried it with soft oil X, the paraffinic oil, and they saw their thrips counts on their cards drop dramatically over a couple of uses. So it's something we really ought to think about looking into more. It makes your sprays more effective because it chases them out of hiding. And it worked not only for spinosads, but I have a couple of customers who swear by it. And more than, you know, if you talk to ornamental growers, it would surprise me if not at least half the ones that you meet already know about this trick. So that's a thought there. I also, on the same vein, capsaicin is very irritating to thrips, but there are other repellent oils that are also, you know, kind of do the same thing in a way as like rosemary oil, for example, or mints. A lot of herbal oils are repellent, and they can do something similar to that. They can basically give you better coverage because you're pulling the pest out of hiding. That's awesome. That's a great, great tip. Do you want to, we could touch on some others. I know that Tad wants to hear about uh root aphids i'd like to hear about russets and we did have a um a special request uh a sap beetle uh robert campbell says sap beetles they found my indoor garden don't seem to be doing much damage he's not 100 on the id but he's kept but he feels like he's got a good match um said that he's captured a couple and they have some kind of gunk on their legs okay yeah i'd need to see them um you know right off the bat i'm going to say beetles let's be luck let's feel lucky and knock on wood that we don't have any major beetle pests in this crop at least not in indoor or a greenhouse they they there are um you know there are cucumber beetles that get into greenhouses and they're in the fields as well flea beetles can do a bit damage when the plants are very tiny but normally when the plant's strong that they can't but so because and the reason i say this is because beetles are they're the toughest arthropod out there i think they're more beetle species than any other animal species on the planet um they're just they they evolved to survive and they found a winning um model uh so they're tough but yeah i want to see them um with beetles i think I don't, what size is this beetle? Cause if it's an indoor garden, like under lights, then exclusion is a very good strategy because beetles, I don't think do very well on, you know, unless it can get in and out of the crop. They're like a millimeter or two. I posted a link to some images in the chat. I don't know if you can see that, but they're, they're very small. And yeah, when I zoomed in on."}
