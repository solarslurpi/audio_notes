Thank you."}], "text": " The fascinating results we have from three strips of ground, all treated slightly differently for 11 years now. And a standout difference is this one here, this strip running from the broad beans to the concrete path, nine meters, and forking the soil once a year, putting a fork in, leveraging, loosening, aerating, has caused over 11 years the yield to decline or drop on average 6%. By comparison with this strip in the middle which I call strip two and this one is no dig but with exactly the same compost on top so there's one variable only fork six percent less no dig six percent more if you like and that one is also no dig the third, and the difference is it has a different compost. So these two are green waste 50%, mushroom compost 50%, plant-based compost, and that one is animal manure. We tried different manures over the years, mostly cow manure, and just in the last three years I decided let's try some compost manure from the toilet, the outdoor toilet in the garden and that's the lighter coloured manure there and that one is giving very good yields of plants harvest. We got 18 and a half kilograms of potatoes from that little area there. Each bed of which there's 18 here is two meters by 1.2 meter. That's just over six feet by four feet roughly. And I've got very detailed records now over 11 years of all the harvests from both each strip and each bed as we run across. So for example, each bed as we run across. So for example, these three beds in front of me, this year, 10th year in a row potatoes, the harvest was 52 kilograms. And the average over 10 years has been 45. I didn't expect that. You know, I'm trying things here that I don't necessarily think are gonna work, but I figure why not try it and see. And we had cabbages for eight years in a row here and in the eighth year they were as healthy as in the first year and in one year 2019 there were 57 kilograms of cabbage there cabbage hearts that is not just not the whole cabbage the beautiful hearts and so I have records for for the top harvest in all the years. And the fascinating thing is that if you look at different festivals, they do better in different years. And the very highest harvest of all has been beetroot, which was 84 kilograms in bed two behind me. And that was in 2017, which was pretty much the top growing year that we've had since 2013 here and the total harvest in the three strip area which is around 60 square meters that's something like 560 square feet i I'll put all these data in the description. This is just to give you a flavor. The total harvest in 2017 was 455 kilograms. That's nearly half a ton of vegetables from this area. And this area is nothing like a full-size British allotment, for example, that's half a ton of vegetables. So one interesting result for me has been like why you can get so much food from not a huge space. We just had a difficult year 2024 and there's been slugs, there's been cold cloudy conditions in the spring and yeah 2024 total is as high as 2017. I couldn't believe it when I added it up. 455 kilograms. So what's going on? Well, one factor is what vegetables you grow. If you want to get a lot of food, this is something I'm learning from this trial is, you know, grow beetroot, for example. They give you a lot of kilos. I find here every year we had over 40 kilos of beetroot, for example. They give you a lot of kilos. I find here every year we had over 40 kilos of beetroot in bed two this year as a second crop after a load of turnips, 30 kilos of turnips. So you've got many options. The main crop in this section here, the beds three in the middle, was squash, crime prince squash. It goes 68 kilos. That really surprised me. And that's a very high value food because squash is high in dry matter. So 68 kilos of squash, that's a lot of meals in the winter from that area. Six meters long by 1.2 meters wide. Comparing that with lettuce, because that's the other end of the scale. Lettuce is almost all water, 99% water. We just finished year nine of lettuce in the same place, bed five. And the average is over 50 kilograms every year of lettuce, loose lettuce leaves. And that's not even the whole year, that's between early May and early July for three months. Parsnips is another potential high-yielder. We had one year over 60 kilograms of parsnips. We still got some to harvest up near the concrete path there. Vegetables that don't give so much weight include leeks, interestingly, but I grow them as a second planting so they often go here after potatoes. And average around 28 kilograms. Spinach, again a half year harvest or less than half year really because it flowers in the summer. So we do it either very early or very late. And that's around 25 kilograms. And the lowest yield of all is dry beans, but that's because they're dry. So there's a lot of food in a dry bean, but I'm lucky if I get 10 kilos of dried beans from one of these lines of three beds. So what's the takeaway from all this? Well I would say leave your soil alone, no dig, don't fork it. So you know forking is sometimes presented as a, well it can only be a good thing, you're opening up, you're loosening, you're aerating your soil. Well you could also be doing other things that you can't see, like breaking up the mycorrhizal filaments, you're damaging the soil fungi, oxidizing bacteria, and that does lead to a short-term boost of activity in the soil, but a net loss of bacteria in the end. Bacteria are really big agents in helping plant roots to grow like in the process of rhizophagy for example so put that fork away leave leave your soil undisturbed no dick just you know it's so simple i think sometimes uh if you've been used to always cultivating soil it might seem odd because well you're doing less and you're getting more, but that's what we're finding here. And then regarding the animal manures, I thought that the addition of those extra nutrients maybe in animal manure would help. It hasn't made such a huge difference over 11 years now. The increase of yield from using animal manure to plant-based compost is like two, 3%, not statistically significant. The toilet compost does seem to make more difference. That might be because we're making it in a very nice way. It's very aerated structure to it. There were quite a bit of wood in there as well. But yeah, generally very interesting. And one more thing I'd say is record keeping. You know, actually keep a few records of what you harvest in particular, where you put it. So when you sowed it, when you planted, what the harvests are. It's very informative and interesting. And do have a look at the description for all those details. Thank you."}
