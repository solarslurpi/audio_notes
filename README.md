# üéµ Audio to Obsidian
Two bash scripts:
- yt2o.sh - YouTube to Obsidian Converter
- mp32o.sh - MP3 to Obsidian Converter (TODO)
can turn an audio file into a structured Obsidian note in which the frontmatter, tags, and chapters as well as the transcribed text are included.

I am running this on a Windows machine, so I am using WSL to run the scripts.

## ‚ú® Features
- Downloads YouTube videos or Shorts
- Extracts audio in MP3 format
- Transcribes audio using Insanely-Fast-Whisper
- Creates structured Obsidian notes with:
  - Video metadata in YAML frontmatter (title, URL, channel, duration, etc.)
  - Chapter-based organization (if present in original video)
  - 5-minute segments for chapterless videos (improves Obsidian's text handling)
- Supports custom output directories
- Handles cleanup of temporary files

## üìã Prerequisites
- Bash shell
- `yt-dlp`
- `ffmpeg`
- `pipx` Insanely-Fast-Whisper installed
- `pipx` `create-obsidian-note` (custom Python script that builds the Obsidian note. Currently, it is installed via `pipx install -e .)

## üöÄ Usage
```
./yt2o.sh [OPTIONS] <YouTube_URL>
./yt2o.sh -d ~/Documents/YouTube_Notes -c https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
- d: directory for output
- c: clean up temporary files after processing
```
## üîß Installation
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/solarslurpi/audio_notes.git`
- [Install `yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- Install `ffmpeg`: We are running on WSL, so
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
- Install [`insanely-fast-whisper`](https://github.com/Vaibhavs10/insanely-fast-whisper)
- Install `pipx`
- Install `create-obsidian-note`: Go to the `auto_notes` directory created by cloning the repo and run `pipx install -e .` This will:
  - Add the `create-obsidian-note` package to `PATH`.
  - Allow running the package's command from any wsl terminal.
  - Keep the installation linked to the code.


## üõ†Ô∏è Software
### üì• 1. yt-dlp
I used `yt-dlp` to convert the YouTube video to mp3 as well as download the metadata associated with the video. The metadata is a rich source of information, particularly when chapters are included. Chapters break up the video and provide topic information.  These are preserved during the transcript.  If the metdata does not include chapter information, the transcript is broken into 5 minute time chunks.  I found if I just translated the text and wrote it out, Obsidian choked because there was no new line.

The `audio_quality` and `post_processing` attributes have been chosen to be the best for transcription based on the kind of audio models like `whisper` are trained on.  I got this information from a Deeplearning.ai course. Although I forget which one. Other postprocessing options include one to retrieve the metadata from the video. They came about after much trial and error.

The output of `yt-dlp` includes the .mp3 file an a `.info.json` file containing the metadata.  The metadata file is passed in as an argument to the third piece of software, `create-obsidian-note`, discussed below.The `insanely-fast-whisper` software takes in the mp3 file `yt-dlp`.

### ‚ö° 2. insanely-fast-whisper
I installed [`insanely-fast-whisper`](https://github.com/Vaibhavs10/insanely-fast-whisper) using `pipx` so that the translation software is globally available within a `wsl` terminal.  I think I was able to get the fast attention 2 code working. I left it to compile overnight.  It was taking many hours to complete.  When it finished, there wasn't an error but the `wsl` terminal was shut.  When I do use it, I get an error: `You are attempting to use Flash Attention 2.0 with a model not initialized on GPU. Make sure to move the model to GPU after initializing it on CPU with model.to('cuda').` I left an issue on GitHub.

Prior to using `insanely-fast-whisper`, I had used both `faster-whisper` and the Hugging Face APIs to the `whisper` models. `insanely-fast-whisper` seemed like a good alternative.  Verdict is still out if it really is insanely fast given the challenges of installing `flash-attention` on Windows.

### ‚úçÔ∏è 3. create_obsidian_note
The third piece of software takes in the metadata file (`.info.json`) and the transcription (`.json`) created by `insanely-fast-whisper` and creates an Obsidian note where many of the metadata fields are transferred as YAML frontmatter in the note.  The rest is the content, broken into chapter if chapter information was contained in within the metadata.

I created a `pipx` install for `create-obsidian-note` so that it is globally available within the `wsl` environment.

## üêç Python files
### üîß create_obsidian_note
`create_obsidian_note` is a Python package directory. If you have cloned the repo, you can install it with `pipx install -e .` If not
```
pipx install "git+https://<GITHUB ACCESS TOKEN>@github.com/solarslurpi/audio_notes.git"
```

`pipx`modifies the pyproject.toml file by setting   `cli.py` as its main entry point. `pipx` also creates a proper Python package directory structure that includes `__init__.py` and `__main__.py` files.

### ‚öôÔ∏è cli.py
This is the command line interface using the `click` library for the `create-obsidian-note` Python script.

#### Three arguments
It takes three arguments:

- `output_dir` (required): Directory containing transcription file.
  - Type: Path
  - Validation: Must be a valid filesystem path
- `basename` (required): Base name for the metadata (`.info.json`) and transcription (`.json`) files.
  - Type: String
- `obsidian_dir` (optional): Directory for saving Obsidian notes.
  - Type: Path
  - Default: Uses OBSIDIAN_DIR constant

#### One Option
- `--debug`: Optional flag to print debug information. When enabled, it prints:
  - Output directory path
  - Base name
  - Obsidian directory path

### üìù note_creator.py
The function `create_obsidian_note` in `note_creator.py` takes in the metadata file (`.info.json`) and the transcription (`.json`) created by `insanely-fast-whisper` and creates an Obsidian note where many of the metadata fields are transferred as YAML frontmatter in the note.  The rest is the content, broken into chapter if chapter information was contained in within the metadata. If chapter information was not provided in the metadata, the text is broken into 5 minute time chunks.  Obsidian does not handle long chunks of text that does not have new lines.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- If the script fails to run, ensure it has execute permissions: `chmod +x yt2o.sh`
- Check that all required tools (`yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`, etc.) are installed and in your PATH

## üìù TLDR

### üíª Git Bash vs WSL vs PowerShell
Git Bash: This is a Windows application that emulates a bash-like environment. It uses MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) to provide Unix tools on Windows. The script works here because it's designed to mimic a Unix-like environment.  I use this in my VS Code terminal.
### üêß WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
This is a full Linux distribution running on Windows. It has its own file system, environment variables, and installed packages, separate from your Windows environment.
### üîß PowerShell
This is a native Windows shell with its own syntax and commands, very different from bash...._So confusing!_
### ‚å®Ô∏è Command Prompt (CMD)
CMD is the traditional command-line interpreter for Windows. It has been part of Windows since the early days and is based on MS-DOS commands.
Key characteristics:
- Uses batch commands and .bat scripts
- Limited functionality compared to PowerShell or WSL
- Primarily used for basic Windows administration tasks

## Challenge when YouTube videos are age restricted
This is a real pain. The challenge is an authenticated connection is required to download age restricted videos. I ended up having to install Firefox.  Then copied the cookie file (`Cookies.sqlite`) from Firefox to the WSL environment.  To get to the cookies file in Firefox, enter `about:support` in the address bar and open the `Profile Folder`.  From here, you can go to the directory where the cookies file is stored. I copied this file into `WSL` in the directory `~/.mozilla/firefox/`.  Then `yt-dlp` worked on age restricted videos with the `--cookies-from-browser firefox` option  added.

__Note:__ _What this probably means is that I need to run the scrip in the `WS>` `~` (`/root`) directory._

## Downloading Livestreams
I was looking at Reddit and a comment noted `yt-dlp --live-from-start [url]` will work on live streams. I have not tested this yet.

## üíæ Challenge When Notes are on Google Drive
__NOTE:__ _I started writing the transcribed note to Google Drive. This is easy if Windows. With WSL, the file system is completely different. I try the approach below which works "most of the time". However, I am having an easier time just writing the notes to a WSL local directory and then copying them to Google Drive from there._

I store my Obsidian Notes on Google Drive.  I use the Windows `GoogleDrive` app to mount my Google Drive on my Windows machine.  The challenge is mounting this drive in WSL.  The "easiest" solution is to `sudo mount -t drvfs G: /mnt/g`.  First, I made sure `sudo mkdir /mnt/g` existed (which it did). Then ran the command. The first time it completed with an error, `WSL (129) ERROR: UtilCreateProcessAndWait:688: /bin/mount failed with status 0x2000`. I then ran within PowerShell as an admin:
```
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```
After doing this, I reran the command and rebooted. going to `/mnt/g` and there was `My Drive`.

After a reboot, I found I had to redo the command `sudo mount -t drvfs G: /mnt/g`. This does not appear to be permanent.

I am also having challenges after moving OUTPUT_DIR and OBSIDIAN_DIR default settings to the .env file. The script has challenges.  I tried removing the carriage returns/possible Windows artifacts.  But I am still a bit hit or miss with this working.
