Luffa, moment of truth. How to get the skin off? Is it really ready actually? Because we didn't have a hot summer this year. I had three from one plant in my greenhouse, which is easily the warmest place here. And this one was the least right when I picked it and it's still feeling soft. And that's about two months ago that I harvested it. This one is drier and harder, but if i give it a shake i'm not hearing any seeds in there so that's not a very good sign whereas this one was the most mature yeah there's something going on in there which just suggests it might be ripe a bit i don't know how many of you have done this but there are different ways of getting the skin off a loofer this may be not the classic one but i've done it before, not on film. I'm not sure how messy it's going to be. You can see that the skin is peeling off, but only in stages, and that's why sometimes it's recommended. And I've done it before, and actually you can see a loofah video I made about this before, where you soak it overnight overnight in water and then it peels off. And actually this is not going well. So you get the idea though, there's the loofah. And if I manage to get this end off, you will see some seeds because the seeds, this is a bit drier. The seeds come out from the bottom. There's a nice loofer in here, but I think it's also not 100% mature from lack of heat during its growing cycle. And that is why the skin is sticking. And I think probably with those other two that are less ripe or were when I picked them, I'm not gonna harvest any, I'm not gonna get the skin were when I picked them. I'm not gonna harvest any, I'm not gonna get the skin off unless I soak them. I don't know what the leuco will be like inside. But now let's just have a look for seeds. There they are. There's normally a lot. And actually that's not too bad. There are quite a few. There's quite a few more in there actually. And they look good. They're swollen so they should grow. Yeah, this I grew from a loofah that I'd saved from last year, and that from the year before and so on. So I'll stop at this point, not to take too much of your time, but you get the idea. And just by chipping away at this, I can get it off. But if you keep it intact, you could soak it overnight and then this should peel off more easily. So have fun with your loofahs.
